# Malaria-Detection-with-Marking-Infected-Area
Malaria Detection System: Combines a MobileNetV2-based classification model and a YOLOv8 detection model to identify and mark malaria-infected areas in blood smear images. Efficiently classifies images as "Parasitized" or "Uninfected" and highlights infected regions if detected. Built with TensorFlow, YOLOv8, and OpenCV.
